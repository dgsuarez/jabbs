Jabbs

This is an unmantained framework to create conversational systems (or just *bots*) using Python and XMPP. All the code was created for my undergraduate end of degree project.

The framework itself is in *src/jabbs*, with some integration tests in *src/tests*. All the other folders are sample apps:

- *src/jabanswer*: Get answers using Yahoo! Answers
- *src/jablog*: Keep logs of conversations
- *src/jabsearch*: Search with Yahoo!
- *src/minuteman*: Keep minutes of meetings
- *src/poorboy*: Really simple eliza clone
